  ## Project summary 
  An advanced fire detection system utilizes room temperature sensors to detect the presence of a fire. When the temperature surpasses the safety threshold, it activates a dual-level alert system. Initially, it activates both an audible buzzer and an LED indicator to notify occupants. If the temperature continues to rise and smoke is detected, indicating the presence of a fire, it further triggers the LED and buzzer while simultaneously initiating an evacuation plan. As the temperature continues to increase, the system prompts the control system to initiate essential safety protocols.
